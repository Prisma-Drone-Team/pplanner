# pplanner, a 3D path planner
This repository contains a 3D path planner implemented as a shared library in C++. This library can be included in other C++ programs to plan quickly obstacle free paths in a 3D scene.

This software uses [ompl](https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/)  ompl for the generation of the path and  [fcl](https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl)  for the obstacle collision checking phase.
